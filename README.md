# p5r-flowscript-dumper
A very dumb flowscript function offset dumper for use with ghidra

(Using this to RE how to set model positions etc externally but thought I might share)

Have P5R.exe open, run the program and enter a search term (reccomended to be small)

it will then write the dumped function name and corresponding function offset for ghidra to a file in the dumper's directory
